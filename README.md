# HTML5 Tic Tac Toe Game


## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed on the screen with a 3x3 grid.
3. Player 1 starts the game and selects an empty cell by clicking on it. The cell will be marked with an 'X'.
4. Player 2 takes their turn and selects another empty cell, which will be marked with an 'O'.
5. Players continue to take turns until one of the following conditions is met:
   - One player has three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). That player wins the game.
   - All cells are filled, and no player has three marks in a row. The game ends in a draw.
